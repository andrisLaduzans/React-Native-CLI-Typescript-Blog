# REACT NATIVE CLI + typescript blog

## Prologue

This will be sort of a work-a-long for setting up RN boilerplate for a new project using:

- Typescript
- Storybook
- Prettier
- AirBnb ESlint preset
- React Native Testing Library
- adding custom fonts
- (my way of) adding svg's

Everyone know how to do these things, until they actually need to do them :) and in my experience i have noticed that it is sometimes rather difficult to find nice material which would explain in detail what am i actually supposed to do to get these tools working all together nicely. And for Beginners even documentations can be somewhat hard to understand so i will be writing these blog posts, as some sort of addon material for documentations and known <i>how to's</i> to shed some additional light. Hopefully i can help someone out this way.
